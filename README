          ---------------------------------------------------

SCCS ID: @(#)README	1.2 05/02/01 15:35:10
    
Cyg4Me is a supported version of (a subset of) Cygwin tools for
building Sun J2ME software on the Win32 platform.

INSTALL

    [1] Unpack this ZIP file to a directory such as C:\cyg4me.

    [2] Put C:\cyg4me\bin as the FIRST item in your PATH variable. 
        For example, type this in your CMD.exe window:

        set PATH=C:\cyg4me\bin;%PATH%

    [3] Now you can use C:\cyg4me\bin to build your J2ME software. 
        For example, to build CLDC-HI, type this in your CMD.exe
        window:

        cd j2me_cldc\build\win32_i386
        gnumake

COMPATIBILITY

    Cyg4Me contains binaries from a specific snapshot of Cygwin. These
    binaries, especially cyg4me\bin\cygwin1.dll, may not be compatible
    with other versions of Cygwin that you install on the same PC. To
    ensure that you remove all PATH elements that point to other
    versions of Cygwin in the CMD.exe window where you're building
    J2ME software.
